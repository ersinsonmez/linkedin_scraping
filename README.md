CSSM502 Advanced Data Analysis with Python - Final Project

In this study, the analysis of a sociological issue has been studied to be considered within the scope of the course. As a subject, an analysis of a private sector/vertical in Turkey (Defence Industry) and white-collar workers (profiles who have migrated abroad) has been made. The data to be analyzed was captured with various scripts on LinkedIn and presented by anonymizing. For information about the project and pipeline, "Project_Presentation.pdf" can be viewed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Persons and institutions within the scope of the project have been examined for academic purposes and to be evaluated entirely within the scope of the course, personal data has been anonymized for this purpose and cannot be used for other purposes.
